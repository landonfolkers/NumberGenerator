# NumberGenerator

This is a simple number guessing game that runs in the console. 

The user is asked their name and then they guess a number between 1 and 10. 

They have to guess until they get the correct number. 

If they do not guess a number, or if they guess a character, the program will tell them to select an actual number. 

If they guess correctly, the program will tell them that they are correct and ask them if they want to play again.
